	Today, children, you will hear the story of shithead the lonely dragon. 
	Shithead was standing at the Moonglow bank with his master (asshole). 
	Asshole was organzing his runebooks and not paying any attention to shithead.
	Curious Jaraxxus came along and involuntarily borrowed a skill scroll that asshole had left in his bag while organizing his runebooks.
